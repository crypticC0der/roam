#+title: information extraction
information extraction is very chill and good for getting more information on text and getting the correct identifiers
[[id:507c4753-11a4-4ea2-abdf-b82b9b031fc5][POS tagging]] and [[id:77aeb87b-d5bc-462c-8532-5b1bc5181eec][chunking]] are parts of this

certain objects in text are entities and his is useful to know
certain objects are related to other entities ie <person> is appointed as a <job> of <company>

both of these rely on finding syntactic features
