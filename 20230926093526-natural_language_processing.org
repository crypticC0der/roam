#+title: natural language processing

Natural Language Processing is the aims of understanding and processing a peice of data represented by a language
this is used in a wide variety of things and has been around since the 1950s

language processing is a wide term, it includes wc (but only when its actually counting words, when its counting lines that doesnt count)

for a thing to be a nlp all it has to do is process language

nlp is challenging though as text is generally complex especially the english language,
you could parse the grammar tree but thats much easier said than done,
its large amount of [[id:06e01287-62e0-4586-9c50-92ffad66698d][ambiguity]] and variability is also a problem

you have to parse [[id:af0f8440-c5e2-46db-8295-67be030cf8a0][basic linguistic concepts]], this can be done with [[id:17e48b88-86b8-46f6-ab20-f4a832ee0b8a][tokenisation]]

there are a number of [[id:6f98f2ce-a834-4fc3-931f-734f7f8b1c56][resources]] to help create nlps
these are often useful in the training and evaluation parts of nlp development
as you can use the annoted models to [[id:acc39b8d-dc2c-4c28-bbff-e661dbf8df05][train]] and then test agasint a hardcoded proven good one

generally we want our models to have a high grade on common [[id:d6bc8870-3a32-4fac-a460-f9221c4af322][evaluation metrics]]
