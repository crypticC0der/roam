#+title: lambertian reflection
this model assumes that light bounces off in a bunch off in specular and diffuse, diffuse being light going everywhere and specular being light in a single direction
the ratio of this depends on the reflexivity of the service

it is a simple model of the [[id:2a07f116-fd24-42de-8c1b-a30e3dcad84f][bidirectional reflectance distribution function]]
