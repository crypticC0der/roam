#+title: morphological analysis
this is when we analyse the subwords we generally look at the stem, prefix and suffix
this is useful for analysing sentiment, and notes about the word, like singular vs plural, tense, person (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and case, and grammatical mood

often we need context and rely on a regex or finite state automata to figure this out

it is easy in english, but in languages it can get very complex, though even in simple languages it is really complex
