#+title: bernstein polynomials
* explanation
the bernstien polynomials are a power set of a t [[id:ade060c4-b9ec-4e6e-a270-d4edbcfd4e2c][monomial]] used for computing bezier curves
they are also the four basis functions which are a set of coefficents multiplied by the expansion of the number of ts and (t-1)s for that point

ie B1(t), B2(t), B3(t), B4(t)

* properties
bernstein polynomials have a set of properties which are useful to consider
** non negativity
  all of these values are greater than 0
** unity sum
they sum to 1, this ensures they stay in the [[id:643df090-d31d-415f-a570-3225bfd02b35][convex hull]]
** convex hull
the convex hull of the control points is the smallest convex [[id:c33cff87-70e3-4cd5-8081-ac3122febdc8][polygon]] that contains all the control points
