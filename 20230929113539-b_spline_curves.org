#+title: b spline curves
a b spline curve is a type of [[id:d390ab20-a089-4c98-818f-bfd60dfccb38][spline]], which is cubic
they arent constrained to pass through the control points, though still bounded by its [[id:643df090-d31d-415f-a570-3225bfd02b35][convex hull]]

they are defined as such

the main difference is the [[id:7e7d518e-08af-49db-bfef-c0eed976f7f6][spline basis matrix]]

note: at the end it is (0,1/6,4/6,1/6) and at the start it is (1/6,4/6,1/6,0)

by doing some simple matrix maths you can convert them back and forth
