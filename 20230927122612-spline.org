#+title: spline
a spline is a smooth curve through a set of points
generally we model these as [[id:13c2bf7a-0918-47ce-84bd-d1b088ba5269][bezier curves]], we traditionally use either cubic [[id:13c2bf7a-0918-47ce-84bd-d1b088ba5269][bezier curves]] or quadratic [[id:13c2bf7a-0918-47ce-84bd-d1b088ba5269][bezier curves]]
