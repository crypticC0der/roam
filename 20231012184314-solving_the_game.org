#+title: solving the game

solving a [[id:00572b70-22f2-467b-82ff-e93fbe2591cb][game]] is an integreal part of [[id:e7ee3b76-578e-419a-b07d-83845abaa81d][game theory]]

given a simple game often we can work out a solution by plotting the payoff by the probability for each choice and find the probabilties where the maxiumum of the minimum is highest
or in more advanced byt still two player [[id:7171bcf3-82f5-4c9a-a7bd-a8769fc7f772][zero sum games]] cases by using simple linear algebra, though for games with large game trees this gets complicated

the fact that we can find [[id:c64312ea-bf3f-45ba-a557-342320f70c04][nash equilibrium]] for all players in a game is interesting

we can also try and do this by navigating a [[id:05c33001-9ec5-4e2d-ba28-0fc386486870][game tree]]
