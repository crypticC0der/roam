#+title: stream ciphers
they are another type of [[id:5ab1400a-4d83-488f-b729-f8df4d6e57b6][cryptographic]] took used similar to block cipherss
this is where you just use an xor, this is computationally good
but its not great, you can obtain the key pretty easily
could have the "key" be generated by a random number generator seeded withthe actual key

generally faster, used for continuious communications
less memory needs and minimal error progatation so good with udp
can be build from block ciphers or using [[id:0d2fe800-cfe6-4359-aed6-93d2cd9ba105][counter mode]]
