#+title: deformable object simulation
* elastic
this is a type of [[id:3b837d60-bc96-4be6-98d7-2ec56814dbe5][physics based animation]] where the body is elastic and yeag
to simulate this we use the finite element method (FEM), first we convert it into tetrahedrals (as hey are the simplest object for a volume), we then know its rest shape and can deform it easily, we generally simulate this similar to a mass spring model

* cloth
cloth has a number of springs and joints and is also used with the mass spring model,

* fracture
this is also done with the mass spring model
