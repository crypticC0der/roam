#+title: byte pair encoding
this has two parts, a token learner and a token segmenter
it aims to generate a useful vocabulary for you

what you do is choose to symbols that are the most frequently adjacent, add a new symbol to the vocabulary and replace every adjacent occuarance of those symbols in the corpus with the new symbol, until k merges have been done, with a reasonable k most words will be represented and less common words will still have subwords identified
