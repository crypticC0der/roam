#+title: hybrid cryptosystems
[[id:622d2212-97e9-413c-a09a-583ee7ce074e][public key cryptography]] is slow
[[id:5fb5fc5c-d6e5-4f25-a33c-c299d2aa4cb0][symmetric cryptography]] needs too many keys
so we combine them both, public key cipher for symmetric key establishment and transportation and signiture generation
symmetric ciphers for bulk encryption
