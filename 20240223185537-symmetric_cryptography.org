#+title: symmetric cryptography
this is where you have a key which is used to decrypt and encrypt the text, ie [[id:5e0ecce3-9d09-492e-aa90-67ce24b90b53][stream ciphers]] and [[id:76d9b7d2-75d0-4b90-9090-8e6e70902928][block ciphers]]
this is annoying due to how each pair of users needs a seperate key, or you have a single key for like a server but like argh so many keys
generating and distributing keys is hard, and then maintaining them also is hard gosh if only there was another method of [[id:5ab1400a-4d83-488f-b729-f8df4d6e57b6][cryptography]]
