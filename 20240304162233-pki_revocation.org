#+title: pki revocation
we need to be able to say that a private key has been compromised or the ca has been compromised or the subject has changed
we do this via sending out CRLs which revoke a bunch of certificates at once (via the X.509-v2 CRL format)
the issuing [[id:607e415f-4016-439e-9f48-c0b6cacffe5d][CA]] needs to keep the CRL up to date which is annoying, and hard to scale
