#+title: cipher block chaining mode
cbc mode for short
$C_0 = IV$ (initialisation vector)

$C_i = E_k(M_i xor C_{i-1})$

each block depends on all previous blocks
IV should be randomly generated, doesnt need to be secret tho

does lead to error propagation, but conceals patterns and block order matters
