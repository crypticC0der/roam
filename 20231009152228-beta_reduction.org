#+title: beta reduction
beta reduction is really the core of [[id:cc639b5b-3e71-4e97-8322-7367fceb41ce][lambda calculus]], and is heavily linked with [[id:bb40f076-4a7c-4f6c-a855-a7d134d1d227][alpha equivalence]]
one important thing to understand is when one term is applied to another that isnt two terms multiplied, if you have $ab$ you assume a is a free function and b is its argument into it

what beta reduction is, is when you actually put the value into a function so $(\lambda x . t )a \rightarrow^\beta t[a/x]$
so $(\lambda y.\lambda x. yx)(\lambda x.bx)(c) \rightarrow^\beta (\lambda x.yx)[bx/y](c) \rightarrow^\alpha (\lambda w.w bx)(c) \rightarrow ^\beta (wbx)[c/w] \rightarrow^\alpha (cbx)$
where cbx are free variables, there are a number of ways to reach this conclusion though

some beta reductions are infinate but we can avoid this with [[id:a99e0567-5962-4cb8-b223-393541a9acd8][lambda types]]
