#+title: game
a game is a situation wherin agents interact and have influence of an outcome,

a great number of situations fall under this from stock market manipulation to simple board games such as hex

we define this as
- a number of agents interact with one another, these being the players, the number cannot be one
  - if the number is one it is a puzzle
- at the end they revice a outcome which we can give a value to, this can be negative and is called a pay-off
- there are clearly defined rules and the agents have to stick to these, when there are no more descisions to be made the outcome is determined
