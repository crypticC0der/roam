#+title: neural network
okay so like nns are useful and shit, i should explain how they work
so youve got a bunch of inputs, and a bunch of weights, you multiply the weights by the (inputs+bias) and then throw this through a activation function and boom you have a normalised output

a neural network is a bunch of these, each layer might have say 20 neurons and there might be a bunch of layers, so neurons feeding into neurons and neurons feeding into neurons and whatever

typically we use the [[id:3548bec2-37ac-4f94-a1d2-4d461426d5c6][sigmoid]] function but we could use like tanh or relu or elu or whatever

if a nn has only one layer its called a single layer perception
