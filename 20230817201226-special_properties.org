#+title: special properties
special properties are things that are interesting to have in a game but cannot be
univerasally implemented in an easy way such as a [[id:530a44c1-3d75-4e62-a2d0-57bd9c9727d3][stat]]

they are implemented as a bit specific enum, with each bit in a integer being a specific property,
only the 1st 7 bits are defined and i will not add any more

they are
- homing
- predictive
- rapidFire
- returning
- spdUp
- polar

originally there were going to be a few other for multi shot but i gave them their own [[id:530a44c1-3d75-4e62-a2d0-57bd9c9727d3][stat]]

generally each attack type defines how they deal with these, ie ranged and area and close,
but each melee attack is so diverse that i have had to implement most all of them individually on each
generally they dont need to do exactly what it says on the thin but it should be understood to
lead to a similar effect

the ones that have minimal coverage are returning and polar, due to how they are specifically awkward
