#+title: ODE
ordinary differencial equations

* correct solver

$F=ma = m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$

we then go

$\frac{d}{dt}x = v$
$\frac{d}{dt}v =\frac{F}{m}$

which is 2 equations with 2 unknown those being x and v

we do this via

$X = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ v\end{pmatrix}$


$\frac{d}{dt}X = f(X,t) = \begin{pmatrix} v \\ F(x,v)/m \end{pmatrix}$

sometimes making a texture of the solutions for these via precomputation is a decent idea

* good solver
$t_1 = y_0 + h \\ X_1 = X_0 + hf(X_0,t_0)$

often we dont get super correct things in some places, but this, this is moreso updating things in a [[id:96f807c0-393f-4c88-803b-d00be72a0937][heuristic]] sort of method, which is fine unless you want circular motion
