#+title: hash function
a hash is a type of [[id:b242c1d8-a99a-49ee-85cd-2d1f83504d2b][cryptographic checksum]]
we have a hash function with and the checksum is just the hash of M
each hash function processes a block of M the output is the input for the next iteration

these have the secuirty properties
- one way
- hard to find another value with the same hash
  avoids forgery
- hard to find two values with the same hash
  ensures that the sender cannot deny what was sent

these are used frequently in alot of applications, ideally salt ur hash tho
