#+title: path tracing
raytracing is very all or nothing with lighting and shadows, this is due to light being a single point, and while [[id:2093f6be-8f12-4e22-b372-70b92d19cb90][radiosity]] is good it is bad at shadows in [[id:8a24b1c7-5e3d-4237-8b47-97951101e110][rendering]]
light is more an object with a surface and so there are a bunch more rays
we can work out an estimate of how many of the rays will hit the object by shooting a few and seeing how few hit the light fully and then taking a fraction
this is similar to the [[id:3ae0e914-3579-447e-88dc-23255e89d561][monte carlo tree search]] method

we can generally make a pretty good estimate with this for even complex things

we send a ray to a pixel and then let it bounce off in a random direction or towards a light and then we basically [[id:3ae0e914-3579-447e-88dc-23255e89d561][monte carlo tree search]] this for a while until we have a good estimate whcih is nice
these need to be uniformly random around the hemisphere to ensure accuracy
this is pretty good at picking all of the effects that matter,
but it requires alot of samples per pixel (hundreds)

i personally think this method of rendering looks really nice
also b good when [[id:ff5a0679-b865-4b60-ba96-02b532ce0b4a][baked]]
