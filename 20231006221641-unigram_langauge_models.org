#+title: unigram langauge models
a unigram lanaguage model is based around single words, and we use word frequencies for probabilities basically
the function is $P(w) = \frac{#w+1}{\Sigma_{w'\in D}(#w' +1)$
which adds a bit of smoothing and gives a out of value word a small probability

though this model has minimal ordering unless you use the [[id:e8d7619e-720a-48ed-afd7-b8cfc21acf4b][chain rule]],
