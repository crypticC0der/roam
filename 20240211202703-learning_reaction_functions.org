#+title: learning reaction functions
oh boy shits gonna get complicated
we know that to find a [[id:f0afdd4f-60aa-4cb1-a652-e3e13ccc76e5][stackelberg equilibrium]] and [[id:36014300-181e-49f0-a082-96e9356647bf][solve the optimization problem]] we just need the reaction function and nothing else
suppose an unknown reaction function is $u^R_F$

we have historical data $[u_l ( t), u^R_F (t) ]$ which is the moves made over time
we aim to find  $\hat u^R_F$ which is as close as possible

we cannot know the actual error, but we can know the error in terms of past examples, we normally find this by summing the squares
then we have a standard problem solved by learning using linear regression,
by getting the mean squared error and then getting the 1st order partial derivative for a and for b
then set the both equal to 0 and then you have an equation for each variable and you can therefore solve this via similtanious equations
