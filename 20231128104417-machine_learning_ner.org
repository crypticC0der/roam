#+title: machine learning NER
you can geterate iob encoding based of this and get [[id:16d50cf1-7957-4c37-a3bf-2ed615fdaa65][markov model]]s to get pretty decent estimates
we can generate a okay classifier based off a large database and then have more features for sequence labelling

you can input a bunch of things like its short shape, chunk and [[id:e342b150-4efb-4707-8a3e-b4ea8514a51c][parts of speach]] and this can help make labels pretty well

some people have used bert for this and its not awful at doing that

the deeper the learning the less future maintinance but the more incomprehenceable it becomes
