#+title: rigging
rigging is generally the process of giving a mesh a skeleton with bones, these bones have fixed lengths and a range of angles

generally we attach skin to bones and skin can be attached to more than one bone
the skin is the mesh, this works by having each vertex being attached to bones via various weights
