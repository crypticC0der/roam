#+title: cellular automata classes
classes of [[id:76ed39e1-b54c-4b9e-80cb-6e7d81375977][cellular automata]]
* classifications
1) automata which stablise to homogenity
2) automata that stablise into osccilating/repeating structures
3) automata which evolve into chaos
4) automata which becomes extremely complex with stable local structures
