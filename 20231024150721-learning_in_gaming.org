#+title: learning in gaming
AI in gaming is much harder to do than minimax and only overtakes it when very advanced

+poker is one of the first things where actual ai was beating minimax due to information loss+

it generally beats [[id:7e3be4c4-870f-4836-bcfa-fda09f6d3f21][minimax]] when:
    the game tree opens very fast
    imperfect information

this is generally done via [[id:21328912-ddf9-43ac-98be-2b43b2d12792][reinforcement learning]]
