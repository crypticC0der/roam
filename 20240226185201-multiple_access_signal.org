#+title: multiple access signal
within [[id:c3f36734-ab9f-4660-b15e-a59e3a6ad536][signal transmission]] the radio spectrum is pretty limited and heavily regulated and we need to have a bunch of people on it so we split it up in a number of ways
- Frequency division duplexing
  assign seperate frequencies for transmitting and reciving
- time division duplexing
  assign seperate time slots for transmitting and receiving

we can have other means of multiple access via channel partioning
- frequency
- time
- space
- coding

this allows multiple people to use the same signal without much annoyance
