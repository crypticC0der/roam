#+title: generating iso lines
[[id:e05908a2-dae6-4aea-9435-4b3438fc7ff0][iso line]]s are generated by finding values that live between two values, this is often done for [[id:2aa770d9-1294-401b-9a23-f2e1cd403f97][indirect volume rendering]] and done with the [[id:4bdb9eb0-e249-4d39-aca2-1b2f9053abf3][marching cube value]]
this is kind of neat and the more iso lines you use the more complex but better your shape will be
