bluetooth is a [[id:23c6acf7-51dc-48de-9a10-d2eddf6e6d31][WPAN]]
the bluetooth specification is [[id:db8f1be2-2cdd-42da-bce0-5d4df821cd68][IEEE 802.15.1]]
bluetooth is short range, low power, low cost and using radio

power consumption being low is critical as they are often battery operated
typically their area is very small, and doesnt need to manage information

the bluetooth protocal stack exists almost entirely in the data link layer

a piconet is a master device and at least one slave device
devices can be in multiple piconets but a master in only one (time multiplexing)
a master can connect to multiple slaves

the master controlls the frequency hopping and correction and clock
