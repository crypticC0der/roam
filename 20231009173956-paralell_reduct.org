#+title: paralell reduct
paralell reduct is basically doing [[id:c669b4ea-7b72-42ab-9cab-47f636ca4f8e][beta reduction]] on everything similtaniously, it is defined simply as

$$\diamond tu = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}\diamond t' [\diamond u / x] & if t = \lambda x.t' \\ \diamond t \diamond u  & otherwise \end{array}\right.$$

what it does simply is if you have an application on an abstraction it does beta reduction on it, this avoids the question of what order to do thingd in


we use this to perform proof that beta reduction is confluent and leads to the same outcome
