#+title: physics based animation
we can do alot of physics based [[id:9888f659-4ffb-4bff-b0d1-9384d221d475][animation]] with things like particals and smoke, we have to use alot of [[id:338e9334-1bc9-4452-b857-14d1d7ff7e56][ODE]]s but yeag
this get more complex if we have things like collision within the particles, because alot of the stuff we have is in parallel

sometimes we dont aim to have it look entirely accurate we just want it to be close enough, and normally use [[id:96f807c0-393f-4c88-803b-d00be72a0937][heuristic]]s

sometimes you can do similar things but with the verticies on the mesh, such as in water simulation and fabric simulation
