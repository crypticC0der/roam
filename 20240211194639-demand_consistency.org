#+title: demand consistency
for [[id:77f29b42-993c-466a-acbe-553990120957][stackelberg game]]s you often have price leaders and price followers,
given two demand models for the follower and leader

$S_l = D_l(u_l,u_f) = a_1 + b_1 u_l +c_1 u_f$

$S_f = D_f(u_l,u_f) = a_2 + b_2 u_l +c_2 u_f$

* consistency 1
if ones price decreases, then the sales increases, if the competitors price increses then the sale will decrease, therefore
b_1 < 0, c_1 >0; b_2>0,c_2<0

* consistency 2
if ones price decreases and the other price remains the same then the total sale for both will increase
this implies b_2 < -b_1, c_1 < -c_2
