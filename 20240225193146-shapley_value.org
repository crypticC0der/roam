#+title: shapley value
the shapley value is the division of payoffs under the [[id:e65a1bee-8bb6-455c-b099-662a2d1b2be4][fairness axioms]] in a [[id:e3ad08aa-0725-4d3c-8b72-09ecbb32225c][coalitional game]]

given a game (N,v) there is a unique division of payoffs $x(v) = \phi^* (N,v)$ that divides the full payoff of the grand coalition and satisfies its axioms

the shapely value of a player is given by

$\phi^*_i (N,v) = \frac 1 {| N | !} \Sigma_{S \subseteq N \backslash \{i \}} | S | ! ( | N | - | S | - 1) ! [v(S \cup {i}) - v(S)]$

if we define $MC_i (S)= v(S \cup \{i\} ) - v(S)$

we can rewite the shapely value to be

$\phi^*_i (N,v) = \frac 1 {| N | !} \Sigma_{S \subseteq N \backslash \{i \}} | S | ! ( | N | - | S | - 1) ! MC_i(S)$

the shapely value is the fair split of the reward for the grand coalition and sums to the grand coalition
