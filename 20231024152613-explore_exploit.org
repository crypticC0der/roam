#+title: explore exploit

we need to figure out like wether exploring new options is worth it compared to exploiting options we know work

generally when using the model and not aiming to learn more we use a purely greedy method

* algorithms
- eplsion greedy
  every epsilon frames we do a random action
- decresing epsilon greedy
  have eplsion be min(1,T/t) where T is a big number
  this means it explores more initially

* slot machine example
- given a number of machines that cost $1 to play
- only one pays a positive rate
- and you have a limited time frame to abuse the machines
