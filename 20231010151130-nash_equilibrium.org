#+title: nash equilibrium
a nash equilibrium is wherin each strategy in a given [[id:537c43e3-e4bc-49be-adb6-25fb2674fb9f][nash game]] is a best response to the other strategies, ie each strategies are equally as good at beating the other
this means noone has any reason to change their strategy really

in solving the game we look for the best strategy for each players given the other players strategies

you are in a nash equilibrium wherin no change to your strategy can benifit you, given the strategies of the opponent
given the prisoners dillema where they both defect, this is the only nash equilibrium

a simple means of solving a nash game is finding where both the differentials of the reward functions equal 0
sometimes there are multiple solutions
and sometimes there are none

often finding these is done by searching ever strategy pair or use [[id:7e3be4c4-870f-4836-bcfa-fda09f6d3f21][minimax]] or [[id:533cd1a1-602b-4079-b3f9-74ca608e4f48][dominance in games]]

* 1950 theorem
in any game with a finite number of players in which each player has a finite number of pure stragies has at least one nash equlibrium plausably involving mixed stragies
this does not require [[id:7171bcf3-82f5-4c9a-a7bd-a8769fc7f772][zero sum games]]

vonn neuman figured this out but nash made this much more generalised


* alternative definition
the two players aim to maximise their own payoff given the others strategy and decide strategies simultaneously
each player has a reaction function which returns a strategy depending on the other strategy
there is a nash equilibrium if $u_1 ^ N = R_1 ( u_2 ^n)$ and $u_2 ^ N = R_2 ( u_1 ^n)$
aka the best strategy is the reaction from the others best strategy
this nash equilibrium is the join between $R_1(u_2) = R_2(u_1)$

this leads to another method of finding a nash eqilibrium
