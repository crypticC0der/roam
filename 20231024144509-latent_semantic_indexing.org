#+title: latent semantic indexing
this is another way of giving information for words, it is muche denser than a [[id:2f880923-c749-47ee-9d9f-34b226ef0a67][vector space model]], mathematically it is basically just single value decomposition, you give a document matrix (d) and then put that through svd and get [u,s,v]
then the document vector becomes u * d, and the term vectors become v*d

we can truncate the svd via finding the number of distinct vectors (k) and then only taking the first k collumns of u and v

these can be plotted in k dimensional space and this is generally quite useful
