counter to [[id:75ad7710-d3fa-44ad-aa05-1db2697238e1][offline learning]] and generally much faster
assume we have a learned function and then have new data to input to the [[id:3e5c9ef7-1f7e-40d5-9c64-38d2ad61a895][learned reaction function]]

the function may change due to a change in the world or the follower changing their strategy for whatever reasons (generally depends on context)
could be youre selling petrol and diesel has been invented or electric cars, could be that followers are switching between long term and short term goals

this is typically a problem of [[id:8876efd5-258b-4ed8-b5e3-5fb919be0754][updating a regression function]]
