#+title: the osi model
the osi stack is different to the [[id:9e499bae-9e44-4914-8d6c-61eb7292fa41][iot stack model]] as it has a presentation layer and a session layer under the application layer
the osi stack was based on the assumption of single technology stacks

the internet stack model abstracts the physical layer due to typically fully homogenous networks, but this is not the case for [[id:bb75854c-84cf-4a04-bc12-420281cfd618][internet of things]]
many of the low level iot devices dont fully support ip compliant communication, we have protocols to extend this functionality
