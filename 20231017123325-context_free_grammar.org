#+title: context free grammar
generally these are a set of equations that allow us to build the structure of sentance
these are used in alot of cases especially lexical and syntactic analysis in compilation but i am speaking here about [[id:7ae464da-5985-4df1-a402-a75063a38e64][natural language processing]] so fuck you and go die

we can use this pretty easily in helping in [[id:77aeb87b-d5bc-462c-8532-5b1bc5181eec][chunking]] as we can take things like [[id:b4b829c4-9d06-4bdd-8504-5e788c8eee68][Noun Phrases]] and Verb Phrases and sentances

generally as a good alternative is a [[id:42fa925b-202f-41bf-a785-e6729e0c075a][treebank]] or a [[id:d5255899-0661-4e75-9761-3f2e19bdc15e][PCFG]]

context can be achived if needed through [[id:4515b390-32f5-455f-a79c-cf0e05332e70][word senses]]
