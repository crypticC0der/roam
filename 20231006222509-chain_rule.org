#+title: chain rule

the chain rule is where insted of doing
$p($ cat in the hat $) = p(cat) \cdot p(in) \cdot p(the) \cdot p(hat)$
we do
$p($ cat in the hat $) = p($ cat $) \cdot p($ in|cat $) \cdot p($ the|in the $) \cdot p($ hat|cat in the $)$
often insted of caring about all of the previous words, we only care about n previous words, generally 3 is good

we work out these probabilities using a [[id:16d50cf1-7957-4c37-a3bf-2ed615fdaa65][markov model]] or a neural network
