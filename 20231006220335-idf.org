#+title: idf
idf is inverse document frequency,
you have $df_t$ which is the number of words with term t, which is basiacally the inverse measure of its informativeness
we define idf of t by $idf_t = \log_{10} (N/df_t)$
where N is the number of occurences in the document
this is high for terms that appear in few documents and low for ones that appear in many, this is good as things specific to the document stand out
you could probably make a pretty okay document sorter by just getting the top 10 idf terms and tagging the document like that

[[id:612bd427-cc49-4550-b51d-d9f3f1017f7d][tf.idf]] is a adaption on this
