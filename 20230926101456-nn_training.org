#+title: nn training
training a nn is generally done via cross validation iteration,
so we break up data into n folds, for each fold we train on n-1 of them,
then we test on the last one,
we aim to report average performance on the n runs and thats a pretty good metric for how good it is

this is often paired with [[id:12dbca09-f6f5-43cb-b439-b3c27e590980][nn testing]] to create a good nn
