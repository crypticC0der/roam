#+title: symmetry axiom
i and j are interchangeable if they contribute the same amount to every [[id:e3ad08aa-0725-4d3c-8b72-09ecbb32225c][coalition]] containing other agents

that is for all colition S that contains neither i nor j

$$V(S \cup \{ i \}) = v(S \cup \{j \})$$

under the axiom of symmetry i and j should recive the same payment, therefore

$\phi _u (N,v) = \phi _j(N,v)$
