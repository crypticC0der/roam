#+title: signal transmission
signals are transmitted with a wavelength and frequency, with

$c = \lambda f$
where c is the speed of light

antennas are how we recive a frequency, and they should normally be 1/4 of the size of the wavelength
so wifi (2.4Ghz)

$c = \lambda * 2.4 * 10^9$

$(3* 10^8) / (2.4*10^9) = \lambda$

$\frac{3}{24} = \lambda = \frac 1 8$

many frequencies have been allocated for a specific use, and the general use is [[id:03b209d2-3f68-4bf2-89d2-ccfcc9459e49][communication over internet]]

the higher the decibel of the signal the less of it will be lost to noise, which is generally why you want your device to be outputting at 100% and then turning it down on your speakers
also decibels are logarithmic, so you cant just add them

decibels are defined by
$dB = 10 \log_{10} (\frac {P_1}{P_0})$

$dBW = 10 \log_{10} (\frac {P_1}{1})$

$dBm = 10 \log_{10} (\frac {P_1}{10^{-3}})$
