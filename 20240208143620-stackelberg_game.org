#+title: stackelberg game
stackelberg games are leader follower games
one player goes first and then follower players go afterwards

to be a leader all you need to do is act first

this applies pretty well to pricing especially when one seller has significant market share over another

another example is how suppliers announce their prices to retailers and then the retailers decide their orders, suppliers can also set pricing intervals

a players strategy space is the set of all possible strategies for the player, the leader has space Ul and the follower has space Uf
Ul and Uf can include a finite set of strategies or an infinite set of strategies

the pay offs are built in terms of Jl(ul,uf) for the leader and Jf(ul,uf)

* payoff example
leader sale: S_l = D_l(u_l,u_f) = a_1+b_1u_l + c_1u_f
follower sale: S_f = D_l(u_l,u_f) = a_2+b_2u_l + c_2u_f

leader profit: J_l(u_l,u_f) = (u_l - c_l) * D_l(u_l,u_f)
leader profit: J_f(u_l,u_f) = (u_f - c_f) * D_f(u_l,u_f)

the follower aims to maximise his strategy which isnt particularly hard given the leaders fixed srategy
the leader aims to find the followers reaction function uf = R(uf), then she can maximize her profit function

* to go first?
typically due to having more choice and power over others being a leader is generally better, given a fair cost function (which is generally not the case), picking options as a follower is very easy

* does a solution exist
** continuous
in a continuous stakelberg game, a [[id:f0afdd4f-60aa-4cb1-a652-e3e13ccc76e5][stackelberg equilibrium]] exists, often being a leader has a worse solution though
