#+title: current versions
- old.lua
  was only "slower" due to more functions to profile and the functions in question being called alot

- new.lua (main.lua)
  warg

- instanced.lua
  despite using gpu instancing it seems to actually be slower
  2s draw vs 0.77s draw

- main.c
  no strong comparisons have been made but currently is running at 5x speed of the lua version
  *but* the lua version is not slow (60~) fps, plausably using gpu isnt a bad idea but who knows
  the thing about the lua version is getting it to work better would not be hard at all

  lua doesnt have bitwise operators though!!!
