#+title: GBT matrix
the gbt matrix is a way of defining a bezier curve,
it stands for 3 things
- Geometry
  the matrix including the control points coords
- spline Basis
  a matrix which has the coefficents for the basic functions for a bezier curve
- power basis (T)
  the [[id:ade060c4-b9ec-4e6e-a270-d4edbcfd4e2c][monomials]] of t up to the needed amount for the curve


this matrix demonstrates how the [[id:ce9f1bc7-1c80-4ac7-9c58-79260d47ab36][bernstein]] values are complex and non linear and cant be substitutated with other parts of the equation
