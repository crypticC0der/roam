#+title: user stories
user stories are a brief description of the functionality a system needs
ie "i want to see my current average overall mark for the semester and year"
we break these down into small tasks and then assign them [[id:88150e6a-20e9-4c0b-a694-f3bd208f8344][value (agile)]]
we build these up as the app gets bigger
 they can have different levels of abstraction and we deabstract them to simple stories over time

 each user story must be a thin end to end slice of functionality
