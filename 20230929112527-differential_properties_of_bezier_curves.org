#+title: differential properties of bezier curves
taking a bezier curve you can differentiate the formula for the [[id:13c2bf7a-0918-47ce-84bd-d1b088ba5269][bezier curves]] and get its differential which is its velocity (the tangent)
p1*(1-t)^3 + p2*3t(t-1)^2 + p3*3(t-1)t^2 + p4*t^3

you can do this again and get accerlation (the normal)
