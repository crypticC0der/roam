#+title: grid cellular automata
the universe generally starts in the same state, except for a finite number of cells in other states,
the assignment of state values is called a configuration, sometimes the grid is finite, other times not so much

often though if the grid comes off the top you have it come into the bottom, this simulates a infinate periodic tiling
this is generally done with modular arithmetic
