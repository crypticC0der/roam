#+title: unix passwords
the unix system uses the [[id:946bc188-f1a6-4088-a0cf-1c8f30cdc351][hashed password]] with salt, which uses the DES
it has a 8 character password form a 56 bit key and a 1 bit parity
then you have a 12 bit salt
the 64 bits from the output are then packed into 11 printable charatcers, which are the encrypted passwprd

the /etc/passwd file is of the format

username, hashed password preceeded by salt, user id, group id, home directory, shell

/etc/password is of the format
user1:hashedpassword:passwordlastchanged:passwordmaybechanged:passwordmustbechanged:passwordchangewarning:disabled:disabled since:reserved

this is not able to deal with replay attacks

the current solution has a different hash, longer passwords, longer salt, uses pam which can support many methods
