#+title: HTTP
hypertext transfer protocol
http 1.1 is mostly used but we are moving to http 2.0
uses TCP at the transport layer, https uses TLS
http 1.1 added keep alive mechanisms to avoid constantly making new connections

* pros
- secure
- enables rest
- appropriate for large data transfer
- json gets big fast and is not optimised well
- combined with rest devices can state information easily
* cons
- high overhead
  fixed by http2.0
- doesnt support push notifications
- header and message payloads depend on the server
