#+title: coalitional game
a coalitional [[id:00572b70-22f2-467b-82ff-e93fbe2591cb][game]] is where you aim to work together as a form of strategy while still aiming to maximise your reward similar to a [[id:537c43e3-e4bc-49be-adb6-25fb2674fb9f][nash game]] but with collabing

they have a finite set of players N

and set of all possible coalitions which is the power set of N (size $2^N$)

and a valuation/characteristic function $2^n \rightarrow R$ which associates with each coalition $S \in N$ a real values payoff $v(S)$ and assume that $v(\empty) = 0$

this payoff can be freely redistributed among its members

often the game is denoted as $G = (N,v)$

* the puzzle
- the aim is to find which coalition will form
  depends heavily on the 2nd question
- and how to divide the coalition payoff
  this is the more interesting question
