#+title: interoperability for iot stacks
the physical aspect needs to be there for interoperability, so we can abstract away alot of old protocols into new protocols with software to interface
the [[id:9e499bae-9e44-4914-8d6c-61eb7292fa41][iot stack model]] uses the link layer to ensure that there is heterogenity support of networking solutions, this layer relies on the upper layers to give standarised interfaces for the iot technology

each layer has a number of protocols that it supports really, and therefore the iot stack model is very capable of supporting everything
