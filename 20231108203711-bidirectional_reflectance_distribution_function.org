#+title: bidirectional reflectance distribution function

this aims to model how light bounces off a individual point and the direction it goes

in radiometry radience is the radiant flux emitted reflected transmitted or recived by a given surface per unit solid angle per unit projected
the brdf simply aims to get how much light is bounced off at a point and there are a great amount of brdfs for
