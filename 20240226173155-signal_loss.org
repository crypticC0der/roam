#+title: signal loss
[[id:c3f36734-ab9f-4660-b15e-a59e3a6ad536][signal]] strength logarithmically decreases with distance

$PL(d) = PL(d_0) + 10nlog(\frac d d_0)$

where $d_0$ is the minimum distance, and n=2 for free space
signal energy deceases due to serveral sources of losses
and it fades with distance

to allow higher bandwith we modulate signals, this is done via modulating amplitudes and frequencies
