#+title: rule 110
rule 110 is a 1 dimensional cellular automaton
it involves a one dimensional pattern of 0s and 1s

* states
[1,0]
* rules
given the two neighboring cells and itself you have

$111 \rightarrow 0$

$110 \rightarrow 1$

$101 \rightarrow 1$

$100 \rightarrow 0$

$011 \rightarrow 1$

$010 \rightarrow 1$

$001 \rightarrow 1$

$000 \rightarrow 0$

* notability
this is also turing complete proven by wolfram and the dispisable [[id:bcb2cd99-22da-43ef-975a-f0a6c01275a0][matthew cook]] published his proff and presented it
a foul deed by a foul genteleman

it is the simplest turing complete system, it is also [[id:a0a4fb04-7f60-4547-ac31-076cd0e0271b][class 4]]
