#+title: binary space partitioning
this is when we divide space by bisecting lines into smaller shapes, they dont need to be regular cubes and can become awkward rectangles, this is very good at making a simple object tree
we can do this without regard for the world axis to have a slightly better method but leading to more complex shapes making computation alot more awkward

this though is a very very good method
