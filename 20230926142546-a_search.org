#+title: A* search
a star search is simpley a greedy search with a priority queue [[id:c7d1ebed-7ddf-4724-a41d-c45e37d498ae][path]]finding algorithm
i know this algorithm best as a pathfinding one but it can be used in a great number of situations, it searches the best node based on a [[id:96f807c0-393f-4c88-803b-d00be72a0937][heuristic]] (distance from source + distance from target)

this depending on the [[id:96f807c0-393f-4c88-803b-d00be72a0937][heuristic]] which can be much more complicated can be much faster than any other algorithm and all better algorithms are based around this, though research into the optimal [[id:96f807c0-393f-4c88-803b-d00be72a0937][heuristic]] is interesting to read ON

especially information regarding waypoints

this can be used in more than pathfinding, and can search trees too, specifically descision trees
