#+title: key storage
key storage is an important part of [[id:667e02d8-e41e-4f23-8bed-83a1f744e552][key management]] as any security is only as good as its weakest link and often that is [[id:9f2d1579-ce25-437d-be71-1a7168c56eca][social engineering]], like why spend hundreds of millions building a supercomputer when they can just give a bribe or use a [[https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security.png][5 dollar wrench]]
attackers may defeat access control mechanisms so the file containing keys should be encrypted

keys should never really leave the device generating them
keys should never appear unencrypted outside of the device
keys should not be on a networked device
keys can be split in half one on a physical object and the other in the machine
memory the key existed in should be cleared to avoid obtaining it
keys should be updated
keys should be deleted
keys should be used properly

typically we have a heirarchy of keys, one the master key to establish session keys, one a [[id:7db17d03-01c5-4efd-8206-bb21efc0b6d6][session key]] to send messages and such and only used for one session
