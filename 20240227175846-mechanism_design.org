#+title: mechanism design
mechanism design is a aspect of [[id:e7ee3b76-578e-419a-b07d-83845abaa81d][game theory]] about setting up a situation to reach a goal while assuming the agents act a certain way
consider a mother diving up a cake, then coming up with the i cut you choose rule

another example is selling a item to a set of retailers, if you ask for their valuation then they will give a higher valuation than is true, if you ask them to pay valuations and assign to the highest they will pay lower than they value to ensure a lower price
the best thing to do is run a 2nd price auction as they will bet their true valuation

formally mechanism design is how to design good [[id:00572b70-22f2-467b-82ff-e93fbe2591cb][game]]s to achive the desired outcome and involve multiple agents with private information

formally there are N players $\Omega$ outcomes, player i has private information $\theta_i \in \Theta _i$, and gets payoff $u_i(o,\theta_i), o \in \Omega$
each player aims to maximise their goal and you aim to construct rules that leads to the best outcome on your part

mecahnism $M = (S,g)$ defines
strategy space $S^N$, so player i choses strategy $s_i(\theta_i) \in S_i, \with s_i:\Theta_i \rightarrow S_i$
an outcome funtion $g:S^N \rightarrow \Omega$ where outcome $g(s_i(\theta_1),,...,s_N(\theta_N))$
