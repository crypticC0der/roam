#+title: public key cryptography
up til now most of out [[id:5ab1400a-4d83-488f-b729-f8df4d6e57b6][cryptography]] has been based on [[id:5fb5fc5c-d6e5-4f25-a33c-c299d2aa4cb0][symmetric cryptography]]
under this method we have a public and a private key, which are [[id:feae217f-6dca-42cd-a420-66dc38d4a86e][statistically independant]]
encryption from one key can only be decrypted with the other

this is based on the idea of a [[id:3ebe1ed5-897c-480d-bd4a-308285edd274][trapdoor function]] or a [[id:1e186726-998a-422f-91ca-895c2389c5c3][mathematically hard problem]]
the keys are related mathematically, but hard to dervice one from the other, see algorithms.org and el gamma encryption

$C = f(K,M)$ easy if K&M known

$M = f^{-1}(K,C)$ easy if K&M known, infeasable if K not known
K cannot be derived from M and C

there are a great number of these algorithms
- some for encryption
- some for digital signatures
- some for key agreement

only few for encryption and digital signatures
- [[id:a834840e-253b-4065-8788-fd10f048828c][RSA]]
- ELGamal
- Rabin

typically these are much slower in hardware and software
