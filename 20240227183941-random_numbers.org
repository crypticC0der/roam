#+title: random numbers
a random number should be unpredictable ie
even if the observer knows all random numbers preceeding the next one it cannot predict it, normal random functions generally arent good enough
a good thing to do is take a bunch of sources of randomness ie stock markets and physical phenomena and put it through a good mixing function, like a hash
