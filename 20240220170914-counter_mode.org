#+title: counter mode
ctr mode
this is where you use a block cipher as the random number generator for the keystream
a counter value equal to the block size is used
the counter is incremented by 1 per block

basically converts a [[id:76d9b7d2-75d0-4b90-9090-8e6e70902928][block ciphers]] to a [[id:5e0ecce3-9d09-492e-aa90-67ce24b90b53][stream ciphers]]
each block can be decypted independantly, and is parallelizable
the counter needs to be synchronized
if a block is inserted or deleted then the plaintext is lost
no error propagation
