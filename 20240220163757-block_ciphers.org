#+title: block ciphers
a block cipher is where plaintext is split into blocks of lengths, these are encrypted one at a time
you have a function to encrypt and decrypt given a key

the cypher should be [[id:9a5a11ea-74fd-4be9-8231-3450c336e907][complete]], have the [[id:d1419fbe-b051-49b2-b0da-501c18fd38d7][avalanche effect]], and be [[id:feae217f-6dca-42cd-a420-66dc38d4a86e][statistically independant]]

a complex function can be built out of simple operations by repeatedly using them, ie
subsitutions, permutations, xor, modular multiplication

larger block size, key size mean slower encryption/decryption but are generally stronger

AES is a notirious block cipher

if a message is longer then a block size, block cipher can one of three things
