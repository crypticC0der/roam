#+title: enterprise auth
alot of the time each pc interacts with the right server and then the secuiry server which actually manages the password authentication
this allows single sign on for multiple services under the same organisation
this generally is built around the point to point protocol which is where we communicate to the ras server which communicates with the main authentication server
this normally works around the [[id:e8dfb06b-e6a7-4508-9fe9-330eab077947][challenge response protocol]] which is pretty neat
the communication between the client -> intermidate server and the communication between the intermediate server -> auth server have interfaaces and the internal means of doing things are entirely seperate
the client doesnt care about how the auth server works as the intermidate server communicates for it
