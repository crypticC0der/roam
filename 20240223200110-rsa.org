#+title: RSA
Rsa is commonly used for [[id:f5fc94cb-8931-4adf-9c5b-9a37ae303234][confidentiality]] and [[id:6bf48a27-7816-4db5-b89b-5cc825a6fe61][authenticity]]
it uses modular arithmetic like most things
it is easy to understand and implement, it had withstood years of pen testing and cryptanalysis
it is well trusted
the algorithm consistes of two numbers, n and e (n being the modulus and e being the public exponent)
the modulus is the product of two very large prime numbers (100 - 400) digits, represented by p and q
rsa is a [[id:76d9b7d2-75d0-4b90-9090-8e6e70902928][block cipher]] the block length is limited by some integer n

this is secure as finding d given {e,n} is very hard and similar to factorising n

the algorithm has three functions
* key generation
- select two large primes p and q, which should differ in length by only a few digits
- calculate n = p.q and $\phi(n)=(p-1)(q-1)$
- select integer e, relatively prime to $\phi(n)$ & $1<e<\phi(n)$
- calculate $d = e^{-1} \mod \phi(n)$
- private key = {e,n}
- public key = {d,n}
* encryption
- represent the plaintext as an integer M in [0 , n-1]
- $C = M^e mod n$
* decryption
- $M = C^d mod n$
