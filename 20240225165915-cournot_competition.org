#+title: cournot competition
this is a special type of [[id:537c43e3-e4bc-49be-adb6-25fb2674fb9f][nash game]] where you have two players competing in production quantities and aiming to maximize profit
it assumes no non unit costs and it assumes all things produced will be bought
$p = P(u_1,u_2) = q - bQ = a - b(u_1 + u_2)$

$C_1( u_1) = c_1 *u _1$

$C_2( u_2) = c_2 *u _2$

the profit being

$J_1(u_1,u_2) = P(u_1,u_2)*u_1 - C_1(u_1)$

$J_2(u_1,u_2) = P(u_1,u_2)*u_2 - C_2(u_2)$
