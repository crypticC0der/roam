#+title: implicit surfaces
you have a forumla in the form f(x,y,z)=0
this is very useful cos you can check if a point is in it by seing if f(x,y,z)<0

it is good at handling weird topology

annoyingly it doesnt allow us to find points on it and it doesnt allow us to change it easily
it generally is very awkward to find and modify
