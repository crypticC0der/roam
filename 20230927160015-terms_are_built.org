#+title: terms are built

* explanation
base case: $x \in Var$ then $x \in \wedge Term$
if x is a [[id:a7c940c4-2976-43d0-97b4-1ce78c5cdbce][variable]] then x is a term

step case (Abs): $x \in Var, t \in \wedge Term \rightarrow \lambda x . t \in \wedge Term$
if x is a variable and t is a [[id:cbf234d5-825b-4813-aee1-153b34b9587f][term]] then x wants to be assigned something and ran on t

step case (app): $t,u \in \wedge Term \rightarrow tu \in \wedge Term$
if t and u are terms we can combine them

** example
$(\lambda x . x)$
which is x as a variable abstraced into x as a term to make f(x) = x

$\lambda x . xy$
which is x and y as terms concatinated, and x abstracted into that
so f(x) =xy

** usage
we can easily build a parse tree
