#+title: irregular spacial enumeration
this is a form of [[id:dbca48e0-23ea-4635-a303-335ec90b6653][spacial enumeration]], wherin we enumerate spaces in arkward methods

objects are often clustered together, they generally arent spaced regularly
this is called spacial cohesion, this is what makes an octtree efficient
this cant take into account how its not evenly spread accross the spaces

this is like with [[id:5034258c-ae3e-4684-a0e8-13a5167b5a4f][heirical bounding volumes]] and [[id:78e616ec-97fd-4454-b7b6-56d5d1ae55fd][binary space partitioning]]
