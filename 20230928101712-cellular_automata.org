#+title: cellular automata
 .

* basic explanation
cellular automata are a model of computation studied in automata theory

it consits of a [[id:d02216b2-49e8-4269-a289-30ea58f32e01][grid]] of cells, witch each cell having a finite number of states,
each cell has a [[id:7223dc11-20fc-47b7-a74c-2ea5bb7a90ca][neighbourhood]] relitive to the cells
you move t by 1 and update the cells according to some rule, which is generally a mathematical function

the number of possible automata given a the number of states (k) and the number of neighbors (s) is $k^{k^{s}}$

for a standard automaton, given 8 neighbors and 2 states
2^2^8 = 2^128 = big

the set of general cellular automatons are
2^129 - 2^16
as there are 2^128 cellular automata with a grid of 4 orthognal and 4 diagonal
as there are 2^128 cellular automata with a grid of 8 orthoganal range 2 cells
and there are 2^16 cellular automata with a grid of 4 orthognal cells, that appear twice so we subtract on of its apperences
