#+title: variables in lambda calculus
variables in lambda calculus can be [[id:3155caf2-4c8f-4dd8-9fa9-3162ca362ea2][bound variables]] or [[id:28e9f12f-9234-41ab-95d7-d039c1136e84][free variables]]

i have touched apon this in other subjects, i think introduction to ai

also note!!! functions can be bound or unbound, if we have lambda x : f(x), f is a free variable

* ambiguity
the distinction between bound and free variables is interesting to note as it can lead to ambigous statements for example

$\Sigma^{10}_{x=1} fx + xy$ where f is a function

$f(x) = \Sigma^{10}_{x=1}x^2$

now when expanded you have
$\Sigma^{10}_{x=1}(\Sigma^{10}_{x=1}x^2) + xy$

what the value of x is is now awkward
we could demand that the variable is the most recently bound version, or just rename the x, we only know to do this as the names of bound variables dont matter

the renaming of the variables requires some precision though is doable but is awkawrd to explain to computers

you can have variables both free and bound
$x +\Sigma^{10}_{x=1} x +y$

* definition
lambda variables we define generally as $\lambda x . xy$
which means x is a [[id:3155caf2-4c8f-4dd8-9fa9-3162ca362ea2][bound variables]] and therin its name can be changed if needed and it is used in the proceeding statement

* functions
note we have a function freshv, which takes a set of vars and gives a set of variables, with a new "fresh" one not in the inserted set

we have a function bv that gets the bound variables in the term
we have a function fv that gets the free variables in the term
