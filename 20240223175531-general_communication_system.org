#+title: general communication system
in [[id:bb75854c-84cf-4a04-bc12-420281cfd618][internet of things]] we generally have things conencted via channels ie
information source -> transmitter -> channel -> reciver -> destination

in the channel part generally noise occurs and we loose data in various ways, we need to figure out how to deal with this
