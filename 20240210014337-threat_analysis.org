#+title: threat analysis
look at [[id:9f2d1579-ce25-437d-be71-1a7168c56eca][cybersecurity threats]] to your system, ensure you can cope with them and assure you have minimal vunerabilities, minimise low cost attacks that yeild high gains, some assets arent worth protecting

do attack tree analysis:
    diagram the goal and the means of getting to it
    diagram the means of getting to each means of getting to it
    and so on and so forth, and then plot out methods of entry, relationships may be "and" or "or"

    plausably add likelyhood of succedding attacks and costs of doing attacks (ie compute cost, time cost)
