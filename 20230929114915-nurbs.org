#+title: nurbs
nurbs are non uniform rational basis splines
nurbs insted of having control points, they have knots, due to how each one has different weight
this also follows [[id:643df090-d31d-415f-a570-3225bfd02b35][convex hull]] principle

these are remarkable and used for alot of things due to their strong flexability,
they are also renouned for their smoothness and have great precision, due to the control over control point weights
they also use homogeneous coordinates
