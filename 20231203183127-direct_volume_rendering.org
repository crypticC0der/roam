#+title: direct volume rendering
direct volume rendering is a part of [[id:8a24b1c7-5e3d-4237-8b47-97951101e110][rendering]] when we dont have a simple [[id:c33cff87-70e3-4cd5-8081-ac3122febdc8][polygon]] representation
we aim to also draw the inside of things

similar but different things are point clouds or volumentic [[id:8a24b1c7-5e3d-4237-8b47-97951101e110][rendering]] and voxel rendering
youll have a 3d model with numbers and we can assign values to those and then generally interpolate between this
you want to be assigning colours and opacities with these values

then we cast a ray and build a colour of the cumulative colour and opacity and this gives us pixel values for each pixel and we can then contruct an image off the set of voxels
this is really good when we can rotate the image and such
