#+title: articulated rigigbody simulation
this is where we have components of [[id:78ee996e-d936-4914-a9fb-38fe8833a24c][rigidbody]]s and they are connected as a part of [[id:3b837d60-bc96-4be6-98d7-2ec56814dbe5][physics based animation]]
their possible movements are expaneded based apon the rotations of the individual parts and then the position and rotation of the body as a whole
