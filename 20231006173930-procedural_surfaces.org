#+title: procedural surfaces
* revolution
you have a 2d surface and then revolve it around its axis
this is defined as s(u,v) = R(v)q(u) where q is the 2d surface and R is the rotation matrix

* generalised cylinders
s(u,v)=M(c(v))q(u)
where basically we take a 2d shape and turn the lines into circles basicalley
