#+title: additivity axiom
given two games with the same set of agents but two charateristic functions $v_1$ and $v_2$
if we remodel the [[id:e3ad08aa-0725-4d3c-8b72-09ecbb32225c][game]] with $v(S) = v_1(S) + v_2(S)$
the agents payments should be the sum of what they would achive in each individal game

$\phi_i(N,v_1 +v_2) = \phi_i(N,v_1) + \phi_1(N,v_2)$
