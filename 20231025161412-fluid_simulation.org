#+title: fluid simulation
this is a type of [[id:3b837d60-bc96-4be6-98d7-2ec56814dbe5][physics based animation]]
this is generally done with a great number of particles and then we wrap them around a mesh and render
we have to use langrangian differential equations to deal with this, its awkward

we can also used grid based fluid simulation, like in noita, this is generally done with voxel based cellular automaton
it looks more blocky but thats cool
