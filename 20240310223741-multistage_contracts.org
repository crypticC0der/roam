#+title: multistage contracts
these are a specific type of [[id:36580c4e-e02c-47fe-9c5d-c560c16bb2ae][contracts]] where they either
- have short contracts for initial development and learning and then lean into a large scale contract when scope is decided
  this increses the risk of changing the contracts later on as theyve been paid higher to figure shit out, beomcing basically a [[id:6b780c51-cfc7-451f-bdd5-ec9b5366aad5][big up front requirements]] but slightly better
- multistage
  this is similar to agile, with lots of iterations and steps, but both side depends on the other heavily and if one bails the other has alot to loose
  these rely alot on trust and often get expensive with lots of negoitations
  often they have a master contract over all
