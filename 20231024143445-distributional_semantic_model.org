#+title: distributional semantic model
a dsm is a model for creating multi dimensional feature vectors to characterise meanings of words, this means you can then mesure similarity via vector similarities, ie cosine similarities and such

the simplest model is a [[id:2f880923-c749-47ee-9d9f-34b226ef0a67][vector space model]], but there are also [[id:738c989c-c505-4d77-a379-08f09d8120ea][latent semantic indexing]] models and then [[id:698d19e9-5bec-4edd-9f42-e10e5206df65][big libraries for it]]

more advanced models are generally obtained via neural networks
