#+title: game theory

this is a important feild of science, despite some beliving its just a theory

[[id:00572b70-22f2-467b-82ff-e93fbe2591cb][game]] theory is a study of how to manipulate events towards our favour,

fun fact alot of game theory reasearch is military funded,
we assume each agent is rational, ie maximising her own outcome
game theory only applies where the agents are rational, and unable to cooperate

cooperative game theory is a whole other beast, also game theory heaviliy applies to computing but is a fundementally mathmatical subject

[[id:fefd545c-142e-4199-a7b5-a886156119bd][examples of not a game]]

we aim to solve these questions
- what is a [[id:00572b70-22f2-467b-82ff-e93fbe2591cb][game]]
- how can we descibe a game plan for an agent
- what is playing a game well
- how do we find a good game plan
- what can be modelled with games

to solve this we aim to find the move where your player is in the best position given any move the other can do
this can be referred to as finding the best [[id:c7d1ebed-7ddf-4724-a41d-c45e37d498ae][path]] to the victory node, there are a number of algorithms for doing this
this is exsitensial logic which makes these problems PSPACE which is higher [[id:1e186726-998a-422f-91ca-895c2389c5c3][complexity]] than NP
