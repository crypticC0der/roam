#+title: game theory

this is a important feild of science, despite some beliving its just a theory
[[https://www.thecelebrityfamilies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Matthew-Patrick-Family-Wife-Children-Dating-Net-Worth-Nationality-800x445.jpg][a game theory]]

[[id:00572b70-22f2-467b-82ff-e93fbe2591cb][game]] theory is a study of how to manipulate events towards our favour,

fun fact alot of game theory reasearch is military funded,
we assume each agent is rational, ie maximising her own outcome
game theory only applies where the agents are rational, and unable to cooperate

cooperative game theory is a whole other beast, also game theory heaviliy applies to computing but is a fundementally mathmatical subject

[[id:fefd545c-142e-4199-a7b5-a886156119bd][examples of not a game]]

we aim to solve these questions
* what is a [[id:00572b70-22f2-467b-82ff-e93fbe2591cb][game]]
- you have a finite set of agents/players that have to be capable of logical reasoning, so ais in games dont count
- a finite [[id:05c33001-9ec5-4e2d-ba28-0fc386486870][game tree]]
- each node of the tree is associated with a move that a player can do from a position
* how can we descibe a game plan for an agent
* what is playing a game well
generally playing well is when you play the best strategy meaning for any move the opponent you make the move that leads to you winning the most, ie you find the move which gives the highest outcome for any of their moves

[[id:b1bce81b-221e-46d8-9005-a09cf7bfc8e1][solving the game]] is finding the [[id:c64312ea-bf3f-45ba-a557-342320f70c04][nash equilibrium]]

as a note though, there is only a best response in finite space
* how do we find a good game plan
given $a_{ij}$ which is the payoff where p1 plays i and p2 plays j
you aim to maximise this if you are player 1 and minimise it if its player 2

[[id:7e3be4c4-870f-4836-bcfa-fda09f6d3f21][minimax]] is good at this, though we often improve it by pruning the game tree as game trees for complex games can get very big
* what can be modelled with games
* note

to solve this we aim to find the move where your player is in the best position given any move the other can do
this can be referred to as finding the best [[id:c7d1ebed-7ddf-4724-a41d-c45e37d498ae][path]] to the victory node, there are a number of algorithms for doing this
this is exsitensial logic which makes these problems PSPACE which is higher [[id:1e186726-998a-422f-91ca-895c2389c5c3][complexity]] than NP
