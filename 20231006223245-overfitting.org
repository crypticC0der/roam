#+title: overfitting
overfitting is where a nn trains very hard and gets really good at the training data due to how the training data is structred
this is like fitting a complex polynomial to a simple curve, this is generally done due to a too complex nn or a shitty dataset

often to combat this we add regularisation parameters to the models cost function to punish it if it tries to get too smart
