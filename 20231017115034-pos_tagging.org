#+title: POS tagging
* general explanation
sometimes as part of preprocessing for [[id:8faaec76-bdd1-4772-aecf-3177ffe321ee][language models]] we can do [[id:e342b150-4efb-4707-8a3e-b4ea8514a51c][POS]] tagging, wherin you tag the various parts and then this can help us better analyise the words

often tagging is done after [[id:17e48b88-86b8-46f6-ab20-f4a832ee0b8a][tokenisation]]

* types
this is generally done in either
** rule based
generally a large set of hand written rules

to do this you start with a dictioinary, assign all possible tags to words,
then you make rules to selectively remove tags
** stochastic based
we use a training dataset and then estimate the probability of giving any tag to a given part of speach

we generally pick the single tag sequence where p is highest given a word and its previous sequence of words

** transformation based
is part of both architectures
tules are automatically induced by a hang tagged dataset

* accuracy mesurement
we want to do a confusion table so we see which classes are being given which labels and then we can see the errors and where various errors are higher
