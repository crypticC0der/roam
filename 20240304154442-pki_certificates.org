they bind a public key to its identiy, it is digitally signed by a certification authority so you need to trust them too
it contains application dependant info, normally email, maybe bank details

typically they are the X.509 v3 format, with a bunch of information and then it has its own mini certificate with the hash of the certificate
up to this point encrypted via the CAs private key

for a certificate to be valid it needs to have a valid signiture, is not expired and isnt in the most recent [[id:15a00e40-9259-41fc-8422-fad1ee18274d][CRL]]
