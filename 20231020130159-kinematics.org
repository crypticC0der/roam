#+title: kinematics
kinematics is a type of [[id:3b837d60-bc96-4be6-98d7-2ec56814dbe5][physics based animation]] and generally is very cool for simulating skeletons that have been [[id:c0c74873-c46e-402c-9fc7-4d912254c0eb][rigged]]
* forward
given a set of angles we find positions for the bones

* inverse kinematics
given a end position we find the angles for the bones, this is much much more useful
this cant get bones anywhere though
