#+title: iot protocols
we have a great number of protocols, but specifically for the transport layer in [[id:9e499bae-9e44-4914-8d6c-61eb7292fa41][iot stack model]]
- [[id:8d7d0dcf-b277-4235-ae62-e52b97c4827d][Message Queue Telemetry transport]]
- Constrained Application Protocol
- Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
- Data Distrbution Service
- [[id:c50fff15-78fd-4512-85ab-e2902e8fb9ae][Representational State Transfer Hypertext Transfer Protocol]]

some of these are [[id:95c66228-7fd3-4097-a3cd-cad16c2a9339][request/response]] (client/server), others are [[id:12195dc5-2015-41c0-995c-2d9cdf682167][publish/subscribe]], most of these evolve and may support both models

the protocols that can deal with higher size generally have higher overhead, tcp adds alot of overhead
typically power consumption and resource requirement also increases linearly
