#+title: big up front requirements
this is where you have a big [[id:36580c4e-e02c-47fe-9c5d-c560c16bb2ae][contract]] and typically have a fixed price for what you aim to do, often the end product is unstatisfory, estimating the costs upfront is often very hard too
this is due to the vendors often needing to recoup their losses by making features a bit shittiy,
this sort of thing is heavily biased in order for the customer and the vendor suffers, and the customer too ultimatly suffers

flexable contracts are a bunch better
with flexible contracts the customer can get out alot easeir
