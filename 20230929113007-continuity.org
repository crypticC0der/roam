[[id:13c2bf7a-0918-47ce-84bd-d1b088ba5269][bezier curves]] being connected need continuity to work properly
there are multiple types of continuity

* continuity
this mainly regards [[id:6fe8525a-cc57-49ba-80da-41fcd3837e9d][differential properties of bezier curves]]
** C0
the point one ends is where another starts
** G1
C0 continuity +
the normalised tangent at the end is the same as the normalised tangent at the start
** C1
C0 +
the tangents at the end are the same as the tangent at the start
** G2
C1 +
the (unit vector of) normal vector at the end is the same as the (unit vector of) normal vector at the start
** C2
C1 +
the normal vector at the end is the same as the normal vector at the end

* enforcing continuity
