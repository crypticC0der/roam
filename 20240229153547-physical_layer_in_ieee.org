#+title: physical layer in ieee
we have two sublayers
- plcp
  which recives msdus and hands them to the pmd
- pmd
  this is resposible for transmitting shit from the plcp over the wireless medium

information delivered much have a preamble which is a pattern that depends on the modulation techniques

for modulation we use [[id:7ca257a1-118d-4262-82fe-53244dc46a22][frequency hopped spread spectrum]] at 2mbps and time dependant with a dwell time of .4s, devices should be confirgured to not intefere by being on the same frequencies
for the duration of each slot the frequencies should be dissimilar
the center frequencies is 2.403ghz and there are 95 channels with the last channel at 2.495, but not all are allowed around the globe

we can also use [[id:657fbe9b-6ae1-4592-8734-e4af14da9f53][direct sequence spread spectrum]] which only has 14 channels (lol) due to each channel having to be 5mhz wide
