#+title: target cost contracts
this is a type of [[id:36580c4e-e02c-47fe-9c5d-c560c16bb2ae][contracts]] aimed to avoid [[id:6b780c51-cfc7-451f-bdd5-ec9b5366aad5][big up front requirements]] they are structured so you are benifited if you deliver early or deliver cheap, but the cost is figured out after a very long meeting

theyre either done via
- cost plus fixed fee
  this is just cost plus a fee
- profit not to exceed x
  this is the profit the vendor makes
