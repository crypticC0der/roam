#+title: challenge response protocol
to fix the [[id:9a84f422-d9e6-4fa8-9bb0-ede11be7960e][unix passwords]] being fucked by replay [[id:cf56960f-5af8-4816-89dd-0c42a9a7d28f][attacks]] we use a new means of [[id:66e059a8-37c3-4a99-9420-4d2a92ff0182][authentication]]
this works via the sever challenging you
so
send a request, it responds with a random number connected to the request, the client returns the random number hashed with the key and proves it is the correct person
this is immune to replay attacks

can also be done by the server sending an encrypted random number and the client needs to send it back

this has a number of variations, like with smart cards or [[id:622d2212-97e9-413c-a09a-583ee7ce074e][public key cryptography]]
