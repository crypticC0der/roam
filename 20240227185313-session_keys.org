#+title: session keys
a session key is used to avoid [[id:5fb5fc5c-d6e5-4f25-a33c-c299d2aa4cb0][symmetric cryptography]] keys being used alot and plausably comprimised
the usage of a session key for one session only means less ciphertexts for analysis and lower exposure
we only generate them when needed
