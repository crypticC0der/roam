#+title: modelling
modelling is the creation of geometry which we define as verticies connected by straight lines
we have a great number of representations we can use
 - point clouds
 - polygon meshes
 - non uniform reational basis splines

[[id:a4b38fea-c770-4bda-82e2-fbfb489ee162][for an example lets model a curve]]

there are 3 ways to model a surface
- [[id:81b87675-7669-4c8a-a943-4da258933402][explicit]]
  when all variables are defined together as in x = sqrt(y^2 + z^2 + 3)
- [[id:ce38de81-e8ce-4b55-9a6d-ad705933b3ec][splines as surfaces]]
- parametric
- [[id:ccab0316-77fa-4e49-8c49-4a52577a4533][implicit]]
  when its in the form f(x,y,z)=0
- [[id:48e7cf55-0cc1-43c5-b875-2e2fb735b4da][procedural]]
- parametric
  when each variable is independantly defined


we can improve models and make them smoother by using chaikins algorithm, this produces quadratic b spline surfaces
