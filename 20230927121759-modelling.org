#+title: modelling
modelling is the creation of geometry which we define as verticies connected by straight lines
we have a great number of representations we can use
 - point clouds
 - polygon meshes
 - non uniform reational basis splines

[[id:a4b38fea-c770-4bda-82e2-fbfb489ee162][for an example lets model a curve]]

* there are 3 forms or modelling:
- implicit
  when its in the form f(x,y,z)=0
- explicit
  when all variables are defined together as in x = sqrt(y^2 + z^2 + 3)
- parametric
  when each variable is independantly defined
  x= sint
  y=cost
