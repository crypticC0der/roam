#+title: agreement contraints
when i talk about "dave has 2 cars" and then later in the sentance if i said "dave and his 3 cars" this would be wrong
the [[id:e342b150-4efb-4707-8a3e-b4ea8514a51c][parts of speach]] need to agree on contraints that hold in rules and set of rules, we could make much more complex rules that manage this but thats silly
