#+title: radiosity

is where we consider light as energy being transferred, this allows nice comfy lighting but fails on harder stuff like transparency
it is much better at rendering the regular diffuse enviroments we live in insted of the shiny enviroments raytracing can do

we do this by looking at transfer of energy and this is exchanged by the components in the scene until it hits a stedy state
we split [[id:c33cff87-70e3-4cd5-8081-ac3122febdc8][polygon]]s down into smaller components when the state is stedy and keep doing this

radiosity isnt used anymore really which is sad but its a good method of [[id:8a24b1c7-5e3d-4237-8b47-97951101e110][rendering]]
it isnt used because it is also a [[id:699d9524-add7-4179-9dd4-975f5583417c][fredholf equation of the 2nd kind]] we can deal with this by turning it into lots of descrete things such as fragment sizes [[id:c33cff87-70e3-4cd5-8081-ac3122febdc8][polygon]]s

this is then solvable by doing $B_i = E_i + p \Sigma^n_{j=1} F_ij B_j$

meaning the light at a point is the emmisive light + the surface absorbtion of each other part of the light on the scene
this has to be iterated a few times so its super expensive computationally
you can also compute this by iterative bounces of light
as patches get smaller this becomes similar and similar to ray tracing
