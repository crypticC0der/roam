#+title: stemming
stemming is when you chop off the ends of words, and maintian the needed parts,
this largely gets rid of detail for the sake of simplicity, it can yeaild forms that arent words yet convey meaning

under stemming fails to conflate similar words, yet over stemming conflates related forms

dont really make a stemmer cos alot of good ones exist, ie a porter stemmer
