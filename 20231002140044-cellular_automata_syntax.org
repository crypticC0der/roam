#+title: cellular automata syntax
what would a general syntax for this sorta thing entail?
how would it describe the general systems

would it cater for n dimensions

cellular automata on non standard grids, are there any actual rules on what a cellular atomata can be
are there inverse forumlas for cellular automatas, this though needs a bijective cellular automata

i could plausably have a kernel for summation, run the kernel on each cell and have a lua function that is ran for the output of each kernel,
better yet i could have a kernel for each state and then i could run based on that
the function could take a number for the state (uint) return a number (uint) which would be the new state

research into fuzzy automatons
aim to make a simple thing that can do a simulation
