#+title: address schemes in IEEE
a beacon frame generated by the ap initiates a superframe

* DCF
applies a listen before talk approach and multiple access collision avoidance
this is used during the contention period
uses rts and cts frames to manage data transfer
ack frames helps avoid packet retransmission and confirmes the data has been recived
can just have a device spamming cts and that would jam a network plausably
* PCF
this is used during the contention free period
the ap polls a device to request delivery
the frame send to the device is complemented by a poll frame
the device aknowledges reception and send data should there be any pending frame
